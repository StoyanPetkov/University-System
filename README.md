# University-System-MVC

There is no register form on LogIn Page, because the idea is only administrator can create other types of user account.
There is Seed Method which populate (on start) almost each entity at the project with one default record.
After starting the project, please run "Update-Database" in package manager console in VS.
The default credentials that will be created for LogIn are:

Admin/pass
Teacher/pass
Student/pass
